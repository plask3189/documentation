        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>
            As before, document your work so you can showcase this project online. 
            This can then be used as a case-study for UI/UX positions. This documentation must be publicly available 
            through one group member's portfolio page. I strongly recommend making a personal copy on your portfolio page, 
            and copying the repo to your Git account, in case your teammates someday take their portfolio page down.

            <h2>Description of Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project was tailored around redesigning the UC Shuttle Application/Website, currently utilized to 
                track shuttle locations along their routes. Issues with the original application include difficulties in 
                viewing information, bugged functionalities, and a cluttered interface. Our redesign focuses on a more user-friendly layout, 
                ensuring relevant information is presentable and specific to selected routes.

            <h2>Design Work</h2>
            <p>
                For our design, we focused on simplifying the map and adding an intuitive search feature. Interviews with users 
                confirmed this approach. Below are the key questions and responses from our user interviews:
            </p>

            <h3>Interview Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What do you expect when using an app or website for public transportation?</li>
                <li>When using an app or website to track something in real-time, what is most important to you?</li>
                <li>Would you like delays, early arrivals, and cancellations to be clearly visible in the interface?</li>
                <li>Have you ever used the UC shuttle app or website?</li>
                <li>When looking at this image of the shuttle tracker, is there anything unclear?</li>
                <li>Is there anything missing or not easily accessible?</li>
                <li>Is there anything you would remove?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Responses:</h3>
            <p>
                Responses varied, but common themes included the need for accuracy, clear visibility of delays or cancellations, 
                and less cluttered interfaces. Many users suggested removing unnecessary elements and prioritizing route-specific information.

        <section id="sketches">
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
            <p>
                We created multiple sketches, including storyboard sketches, to conceptualize the redesign. Our final design includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A map on the right side with routes hidden by default to reduce clutter.</li>
                <li>A left-side panel featuring shuttle information, a search area for starting and destination stops, 
                    and next bus arrival times.</li>
                <li>Timetable functionality to dynamically update based on user input.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="background-research">
            <h2>Background Research</h2>
            <p>
                Our research included examining the Transit Mobile App and airline apps for inspiration. We adopted features 
                such as real-time updates and query-first interfaces, integrating these into our redesign.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="interface">
            <h2>Interface in Detail</h2>
            <p>
                The redesign includes features such as live maps using the Google Maps API, a search function, shuttle operation hours, 
                and a timetable. Live shuttle locations and interactive stops enhance user experience.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                We used the Google Maps API for live map integration and the Svelte framework for the website. The project is hosted on Vercel.

        <section id="ai-usage">
            <h2>AI Usage</h2>
            <p>
                AI tools were used to resolve issues with the Google Maps API and container layout, enhancing the overall design.

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                Future enhancements include implementing additional routes, intelligent routing algorithms, and intuitive visual systems 
                to distinguish routes.
